## The Data
In this notebook, I use python to analyze emissions by country between 1970 and 2012. The database I am analyzing is supported by the European Untion and specifically shows green house gas emissions by country. It has 12 columns and 8385 rows. 

## My Analysis
In this notebook, I do some exploratory data analysis and visualizations before creating more meaningful analysis. Eventually, I plotted emissions per GDP in Afghanistan from 1970 to 2012 as well as created a horizontal bar chart showing each country's emissions per GDP in the year 2012. This analysis showed that Qatar had the highest emissions per GPD in 2012. I then plotted Qatar's emissions per GDP from 1970 to 2012 to show how Qatar's emissions per GDP have been on the decline, despite still being extremeley high.
